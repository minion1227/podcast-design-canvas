# Start From Previous Episode

A recurring show should be able to start a new episode from the last one, keeping its look and structure while swapping in new recordings.

## User Goal

A creator producing a series should be able to begin a new episode pre-filled from a recent episode of the same show, then replace the speakers, topic, and media without rebuilding the design.

## What Carries Forward

Starting from a previous episode should bring over the reusable parts of that episode:

- layout, preset style, and pacing
- brand kit and on-screen identity
- segment order and recurring title moments
- recurring host roles and lower-third styling
- sponsor placement rules
- export destination defaults

It should not carry forward the previous episode's guests, topic, recordings, or one-off moments unless the creator keeps them on purpose.

## Difference From Templates

A saved show template in `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` is the durable, curated identity for a show. Starting from a previous episode is a faster convenience that clones a specific recent episode as a draft. When the creator wants the change to stick for every future episode, they should save it back to the template rather than only into the next clone.

After the draft opens, new recordings should still pass through `docs/episode-ingest-readiness.md` so the reused speaker buckets, track health, and role mapping are confirmed against the new episode's actual media rather than silently copied forward from the older one.

## Creator Controls

The creator should be able to:

- start a new episode from a recent episode of the same show
- choose what carries over before the new episode opens
- clear the previous guests and topic while keeping the design
- import the new recordings into the existing speaker buckets
- save any refinements back to the show template for future episodes

This should feel like a fast starting point between `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` and `docs/episode-ingest-readiness.md`: reuse the show's proven structure first, then confirm the new episode's real speakers and files before styling continues.

## Review States

Keep clone status simple and creator-facing:

- draft from previous — the new episode opened with reusable design from a recent episode
- media replaced — new recordings are imported into the existing speaker buckets
- roles confirmed — speaker buckets and roles match the new episode's actual media
- ready to style — ingest readiness cleared and preset or canvas work can continue
- saved to template — refinements were saved back to the show template for future episodes

Each state should describe what the creator should do next, not which episode was cloned.

## Boundaries

Starting from a previous episode should stay a draft starting point, not a link to the finished episode. Editing the new episode must never change the already exported episode it started from.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that makes recurring episodes faster to start while keeping each episode distinct. Close work that copies guests or recordings across episodes by default, links a new episode back to a finished export, or duplicates the saved-template workflow.
