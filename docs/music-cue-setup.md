# Music Cue Setup

Music cues should enter an episode as purposeful show assets, not as a hidden technical audio layer.

## User Goal

A creator should be able to add approved music to structural podcast moments, preview it with the current episode, and save useful choices to the show template.

## Cue Sources

Support clear sources:

- uploaded music file
- saved show template cue
- starter cue from a preset style
- sponsor-provided track
- previously used show asset

Every cue should show whether the creator has usage approval before it can be used in a publishable export.

## Usage Approval

Usage approval should confirm the creator allowed this cue in the finished episode, not open a separate rights-management workflow.

| Cue source | Source spec | Relevant section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| uploaded music file or reused show asset | `docs/episode-asset-library.md` | Safety Rules |
| sponsor-provided track | `docs/sponsor-placement-review.md` | Sponsor Inputs |
| saved show template cue | `docs/show-template-adaptation.md` | Template Contents |
| starter cue from a preset style | `docs/preset-style-picker.md` | Preset Cards |

Flag missing approval only when the cue is placed in the export, as described in `docs/export-readiness-review.md` Placed Cue Warnings. Unused library music and draft cues should not block readiness.

## Placement Flow

Place music by episode purpose before exposing timing controls:

- intro starts before the first speaker
- outro starts near the final sign-off
- segment transition sits between two planned sections
- sponsor bed attaches to a sponsor read
- title moment accent supports one highlighted moment
- chapter bumper separates named chapters only when chapters exist

The product should preview each cue against the current episode audio and show the speaker or chapter context around the placement.

## Cue Safety Mapping

`docs/music-sound-cues.md` defines the creator-facing cue types and quality checks that this setup flow should honor once a cue is chosen and placed.

| Cue concern | Source spec | Relevant section |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cue type and episode purpose | `docs/music-sound-cues.md` | Cue Types |
| creator-facing loudness and timing controls | `docs/music-sound-cues.md` | Controls |
| repeated, too-loud, or branding-conflicting cues | `docs/music-sound-cues.md` | Safety Checks |
| speech clarity after placement | `docs/music-ducking-under-speech.md` | Relationship To Cue Setup, When To Flag |

Setup should keep these checks inside the same cue workflow. A creator should not have to re-create the cue in a separate music browser just to understand why it needs review.

## Creator Controls

Use simple controls:

- choose cue
- preview here
- start earlier
- start later
- shorter
- longer fade
- quieter
- remove from episode
- save to template

Avoid asking creators to manage audio lanes, waveform handles, routing, or mixer-style automation in the default path.

## Review States

Useful setup states include:

- ready
- missing usage approval
- cue not placed
- overlaps important speech
- template cue needs review
- unavailable file

These states should appear in audio review and publish readiness only when they affect the finished episode.

## Cue Re-Validation

A cue that was ready in an earlier export should not be trusted forever. Re-check each placed cue at the start of every new export, because the creator's clearance to use it can lapse and a source file can disappear between one publish and the next.

Re-validation should compare a cue against two things that change over time:

- whether the cue still has usage approval, meaning the creator's confirmation that this music is allowed in the finished episode, the same approval recorded when the cue was first set up
- whether the chosen source file can still be loaded for this export

When a previously ready cue no longer passes, return it to the matching setup state and tell the creator what changed in plain language, such as "The intro music no longer has usage approval for this episode" or "The outro music file can no longer be found." A cue should never silently fall back to silence or to a different track.

Offer recovery without starting over:

- renew approval for the same cue
- relink the missing file to the same placement
- replace with another approved cue in the same spot
- remove the cue from this export

Keep this re-check tied to export. A cue that stays a draft or sits unused in the library should not be re-validated or flagged until it would actually ship.

## Template Reuse

Show templates may remember cue purpose, chosen asset, relative placement, and simple fade choices. Future episodes should re-check those cues against new chapter timing, speaker volume, sponsor reads, and episode length before treating them as ready.

## Maintainer Acceptance Notes

Accept work that lets creators add approved music to structural podcast moments with simple placement and preview controls tied to the show template. Close work that exposes audio lanes, waveform handles, routing, or mixer-style automation in the default path, or that treats music setup as a separate rights-management workflow instead of a creator-facing usage approval check.
